    The Fimsh Hierarchy
  </h2>
  <p>
    In the hierarchical structure of Fimsh society, the normal fish would indeed be positioned at the very bottom. These
    are the Fimsh who have not yet developed advanced cognitive abilities or gained recognition within the society. They
    contribute to the everyday functioning of the community, such as gathering food and maintaining the infrastructure
    of Aquatica.

    In the hierarchical structure of Fimsh society, the normal fish would indeed be positioned at the very bottom. These
    are the Fimsh who have not yet developed advanced cognitive abilities or gained recognition within the society. They
    contribute to the everyday functioning of the community, such as gathering food and maintaining the infrastructure
    of Aquatica.
  </p>
  <p>
    Above the normal fish are the various specialized classes of Fimsh, each with its unique role and responsibilities.
    These classes include scholars, artists, scientists, engineers, and diplomats, among others. Each class focuses on a
    specific area of expertise and contributes to the advancement and prosperity of the Fimsh society.
  </p>
  <p>
    At the pinnacle of the hierarchy stands Lord Lumarius, the dictator of the Fimsh society. Lord Lumarius is an
    exceptionally wise and respected Fimsh who possesses vast knowledge and leadership abilities. Lord Lumarius is
    responsible for making final decisions on matters that affect the entire Fimsh community and ensuring the overall
    well-being of Aquatica.
  </p>
  <p>
    Directly below Lord Lumarius is the Finarch Council, which acts as a round table of the highest-ranking members from
    each specialized class. The Finarchs serve as advisors to Lord Lumarius and represent the interests of their
    respective domains. They provide counsel, share information, and discuss important matters that require collective
    decision-making.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Finarchs, while holding significant influence, do not have absolute power. They act as the voice of their
    constituents and work collectively to ensure the smooth functioning and progress of Fimsh society. The Finarch
    Council meets regularly to deliberate on policies, address societal issues, and propose initiatives that promote the
    growth and well-being of the Fimsh community.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communication between Lord Lumarius and the Finarchs is essential for effective governance. The Finarchs report to
    Lord Lumarius, sharing updates on the progress and challenges faced within their respective areas of expertise. They
    also provide recommendations and strategies to address any issues that may arise.
  </p>
  <p>
    While Lord Lumarius holds a position of authority, the Fimsh society is not characterized by a dictatorship in the
    conventional sense. The system emphasizes collective decision-making, where knowledge, expertise, and the well-being
    of the community take precedence over individual power. This ensures a balanced and inclusive approach to governance
    within the Fimsh society.
